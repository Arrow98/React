# Accordion Page

This is a simple React project to help you practice front-end development by **cloning a real-world website**.

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_LINK_HERE>
cd <project-folder>
npm install
```

2. **Start the development server:**

```bash
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your project.

## ðŸ“‚ Accordion Component Instructions

> The first part of this website clone includes creating an **Accordion component**. Follow these rules carefully:

1. **Clone the design exactly** as shown in the reference image.
2. **Only one accordion section should be open at a time**. When a user clicks the **plus button**, the clicked section should expand and the previously open one should close.
3. **Apply smooth transitions and animations** when showing or hiding content to improve user experience.

ðŸ‘‰ Use the provided `accordion-data.json` in `data` folder for your content.
